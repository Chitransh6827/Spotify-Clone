**Spotify Clone: A Passion Project -**

**Crafting a personalized music experience, one line of code at a time.**

This responsive web-based music player is a passion project inspired by Spotify. While the static design is complete, I'm currently developing the interactive elements using JavaScript.

**Built with Passion & Code**

The foundation of this project is built with HTML and CSS. I'm excited to bring it to life with JavaScript to create a seamless and engaging user experience.

**Join the Journey**

I'm actively seeking feedback and contributions to enhance this project. Feel free to explore the code, suggest improvements, or even collaborate on development.

Let's build a Spotify clone together!
